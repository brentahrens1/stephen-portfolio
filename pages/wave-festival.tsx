                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>Create a poster that showcases balance, hierarchy, color palette and type pairing. The mission to depict a city surrounded by water that was reminiscent of a collage was intentionally made using only squares, circles, triangles and various drop shadows to tie in with the arts and crafts theme.</p>
